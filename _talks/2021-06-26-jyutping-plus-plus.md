This presentation introduced Jyutping++, an enhanced romanization system for Pan-Cantonese varieties that extends beyond standard Jyutping to accommodate dialectal variations and provide more comprehensive phonetic representation.

Key contributions include:
- Enhanced notation system for Cantonese tone sandhi
- Extended coverage for regional Cantonese varieties
- Implementation strategies for computational applications
- Integration with existing Cantonese language technology stack

The work represents a significant step toward more inclusive computational tools for the diverse Cantonese language family.
