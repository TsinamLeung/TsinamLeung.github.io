## Welcome to Zinan Liang's Academic Website

( Contents adjusted by AI, Claude 4)

I am an incoming **Master of Arts in Linguistics** student at the **National University of Singapore (NUS)**, starting in August 2025. With a foundation in network engineering and computational linguistics, my goal is to leverage advanced IT techniques to safeguard linguistic diversity, particularly the Cantonese language family, through open-source tools and digital solutions like **Jyutping++**, **TypeDuck**, and Cantonese text corpora.

- **GitHub:** [TsinamLeung](https://github.com/TsinamLeung)

### Research Interests & Mission

My work sits at the intersection of computational linguistics and language preservation. I am passionate about:

- **Cantonese Language Technology:** Developing computational tools and resources for Cantonese, an under-resourced but culturally vital language
- **Language Model Development:** Building specialized models for Yue dialects and cross-dialectal applications
- **Digital Language Preservation:** Creating sustainable, open-source infrastructure for linguistic diversity
- **Corpus Linguistics:** Large-scale data collection and analysis for Sinitic languages

### Current Projects

I'm actively involved in several initiatives that bridge technology and linguistics:

- **[TypeDuck](https://typeduck.org):** Developer of Cantonese IME with multilingual dictionary capabilities
- **[Jyutping++](https://jyutjam.org):** Enhanced romanization system for Pan-Cantonese varieties
- **[CanCLID](https://github.com/CanCLID):** Contributor to Cantonese computational linguistics infrastructure
- **[Lingnaam Jyutjam](https://jyutjam.org):** Member focusing on dialectological research and tool development
